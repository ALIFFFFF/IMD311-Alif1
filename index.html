<h1>Dreaming of Being the Best Footballer</h2
<p>Today, Malaysian people need to stay at home during this MCO because of this covid-19 that is happening around the world right now, in the last few days, I am having a nice dream that I should share today. It is a dream where I am becoming world best football player known as Balloon d'or because of my achievement throughout the year. It happen after I am captaining Malaysia to win first ever FIFA World Cup by beating Indonesia three to two goals where I am scoring a hattrick for Malaysia.</p>
<p>Before the match started, I can feel the atmosphere were very tense as it is the biggest stage ever for footballer to play in the final during their career as footballer. We go out to the pitch accompanied by mascot children. After sang our national song the match started with we get the ball. The first five minutes we played very well before the opponent team start with their formation. After that they get the possession ball and they hold the ball very good, about 23 minutes later, they started the counter attack and they scored the very important goals whom scored by Harith Mulyana assisted by Irfan Fattah. After that, the matches restart and we have to search for goal to make it level. After we played as usual and safe, the counter attacking gameplay that played by them really dangerous that almost make it two nil only denied by heroic save by Izzat that make it a corner kick. I and my teammate were relieved but it is not long where they got the second goals from corner kick scored by Alvenos Supriadi through crossing by Titus Haiqal and finish it with a good header. With their second goals, the whistle blown showed that the first half is ended and at that time I saw fans and my teammates started to lose their hopes to win the cup</p>
<p>In the dressing room, all my teammates started to mumbling and feeling sadness whether we can make the scoreline different. As a captain, I told them that the game is not yet over as we have second half of story to make a comeback. I also told them to remember about Miracle in Istanbul where Liverpool make comeback against AC Milan to win the UEFA Champions League in 2005 and told them "Let us make something good ending story for us to tell to our children or grandchildren about what happen today" after that memorable speech we start the second half with full spirit. But the fans still in despair and I confident that I can brought back their smile. After 13 minutes of second half started we attacked the opponent very well and after that we have a chance to goals but their defender make a tackle that won us a freekick. With my confident of my ability to score I managed to pull one goal closer and gave our fans a hope. Throughout the match, we dominate the game and we started to dream where at minutes of 84, I scored a beautiful overhead kick that break the stadium atmosphere with screaming of fans as well we celebrating the goals happily. With that goal we back to square again and try searching for winning goal.</p>
<p>With six minutes to go, we still trying to find one more goal because we do not want the match to go in an extra time because we started to felt exhausted because we use too much energy to find the second goals. At the same time, opponent team attacked and get a cornerkick and they take their time because there only two minutes left for second half to end. People always said "miracle will not happen if you do not anything" at that time it will always forever in my mind about what happen because the miracles that we hope for its to happen a happening where Izzat catch the ball for us to make a counter attack and he passed the ball to Joshua Harith before he passed the ball to Zarith Alvenos. With two opponent player started to approach Zarith I called him to give me the ball and without any second and brought the ball from half the pitch.As I ran  there are five player approached me and tackled to stop me from go further to the opponent goal. I dodge all of them with my exceptional skills that I polished from when I was younger and make it through and face the last line man which is the goalkeeper one on one. All our fans and my teammates hope that I scored the goal and I do not want to trample their hope I scored the goal with calm composure and chip the ball to make the goalkeeper cannot reach his hand to the ball and we started to screaming because it was best moment ever and the reffree blows the whistle and we are crowned as champion.</p>
<p>After a few weeks we were crowned as champion, there are award for best player called as Balloon D'Or and I was shortlisted in final competing with three other player whom are well known which is Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. With they announced the winner and what is more suprising is that I won the prestige award that I have been dreamed of when I was young it bring tears of joy in me and I am proud because I won it not only because of me but who support me to be at this level. Before I happily lift the award my dreams is ended and the time show the clock at 10.00 in the morning. Felling sad because it ended the way that I am not expect. So, I spent my time to learn and refresh back my skills using photoshop to make the dreams come true and finally I get the ending that I want and the result is the picture at the top of my story today. I think having a dream sometimes are good because it make you inspire and make you want to do something extraordinary in our life.That is what I do during one of day in this MCO day</p>
